## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

We are interested in sales data and exploring customers' purchase patterns.


## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words:

Our dataset consists of sales data from an American superstore. More specifically the dataset is a collection of transactions that occurred at several store locations within the united states over four years. The intended use of the dataset is to practice forecasting. The dataset includes 9800 rows and 18 unique columns. The size of our dataset makes us confident that we will be able to produce robust models for our analysis. The data has a wealth of useful attributes including time, location, and product category to name a few. The data appears to be especially suited for time series analysis and transaction location analysis because there are multiple time and location attributes to choose from. There are over 1800 unique product ids with 3 unique product categories and 17 sub-categories. The product information combined with customer attributes in the dataset makes purchasing behaviour another potential area of analysis. Given the rich detail of this dataset, our group is very excited to begin working with the set and seeing how this project will evolve.
